# BadgeAbuse

Allows you to get an active Discord developer badge.

# FIRST ENABLE:
- In order for the bot to run, you need to create a file called config.py, which will contain the variable API_TOKEN.
**(EXAMPLE: API_TOKEN = "BOT TOKEN")**

# COMMANDS:
- /help 

# NOTE:
- You must invite the bot to a server that has community mode enabled.
- Here you can check if the active developer badge is available to you: https://discord.com/developers/active-developer
- In order to detect command usage, you or at least one person on the team that owns the app needs to have "Use data to improve Discord" enabled within User Settings > Privacy & Safety. At least 24 hours need to pass after we detect a command, so make sure to wait 24 hours after enabling this setting before trying again.
